## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Jamie Christian II**, an ECBA-certified Business Analyst with a bachelor’s degree in Entrepreneurial Management from Virginia Union University.

I’m passionate about solving business problems through data, process modeling, and stakeholder engagement. I’ve completed structured training in business analysis (ECBA), where I learned to gather requirements, create workflow models, analyze business needs, and deliver documentation aligned with BABOK principles.

Through my portfolio projects, I’ve built dashboards in **Power BI** and **Tableau**, worked with **Excel** and **SQL** for data analysis, and delivered BA artifacts like **BRDs**, **risk registers**, **use case diagrams**, and **stakeholder maps**.

I’m actively pursuing entry-level Business Analyst roles and always open to opportunities to grow, contribute, and collaborate.
